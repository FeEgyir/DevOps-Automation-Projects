**Technologies:** Terraform, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB  
**Key Features:**
- Lambda function deployments
- API Gateway configuration
- DynamoDB table management
- CloudWatch logging and monitoring
- Custom IAM roles and policies

### 6. Jenkins Pipeline for Terraform Deployments
**Description:** Integration of Terraform with Jenkins for automated AWS infrastructure provisioning.  
**Technologies:** Jenkins, Terraform, AWS  
**Key Features:**
- Infrastructure pipeline with approval gates
- Terraform plan generation and review
- AWS credentials management in Jenkins
- Parallel infrastructure deployments
- Infrastructure testing automation

### 7. Docker Container Orchestration with ECS
**Description:** AWS ECS-based container orchestration environment.  
**Technologies:** Docker, AWS ECS, ECR, Terraform  
**Key Features:**
- Task definitions and service configurations
- ECS cluster design and deployment
- Load balancing with Application Load Balancer
- Auto scaling policies
- ECR integration and image deployment

### 8. Kubernetes Deployment Pipeline
**Description:** Automated pipeline for deploying applications to EKS.  
**Technologies:** Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EKS  
**Key Features:**
- Containerized application builds
- Kubernetes manifest generation
- Pipeline stages for different environments
- Integration testing in ephemeral environments
- Rollback capabilities

### 9. Terraform-Managed Kubernetes Infrastructure
**Description:** Complete Kubernetes platform on AWS using Terraform.  
**Technologies:** Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS EKS, AWS VPC  
**Key Features:**
- EKS cluster provisioning with node groups
- VPC and subnet configuration
- Security group management
- Add-on installations (metrics server, cluster autoscaler)
- Worker node configuration and scaling

### 10. Multi-Region Disaster Recovery with Terraform
**Description:** AWS multi-region infrastructure for disaster recovery.  
**Technologies:** Terraform, AWS (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, Route 53)  
**Key Features:**
- Multi-region AWS infrastructure
- Cross-region replication
- Automated failover mechanisms
- Infrastructure recovery testing
- Terraform workspaces for region management
